# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tien (@tantientantien)!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software developer passionate about building meaningful systems and exploring the power of Artificial Intelligence — especially in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). I believe that **a great engineer isn’t defined by how many lines of code they write, but by the mindset that guides their hand.**

## 👀 Interests
- Backend Development (currently focusing on .NET and clean architecture)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Building educational and collaborative platforms
- Developer tooling and productivity

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Advanced concepts in Machine Learning and NLP
- Designing scalable backend systems
- Building better developer experiences with tools like AutoMapper, MediatR, MassTransit, and more

## 💞️ Open to Collaborate On
- Open-source tools or platforms that support learning and growth
- Projects related to AI/NLP
- Backend-heavy systems with real-world impact

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I enjoy building small systems just to learn how things work under the hood — from caching strategies to authorization logic. Sometimes, I try to explain my code to AI to see if it makes sense 😄
